## About This Project

Hobby Spot is a full stack discussion forum application. Users are able to create an account
 and can then log in using their account information to view posts.

Ourmotivation behind this is as individuals who are very diverse in their interests, we all wanted an application that would allow
us to explore different hobbies, as well as share our own with other people.

 Some of the challenges faced during creation was connecting the frontend and backend, making sure the git process flow went smoothly,
 making sure authentification and routes didn't leak any user data, as well as setting up connections between models.

 Future goals for this project include adding a dynamic search bar to allow users to view a page based solely on a single discussion,
 add more authentification on the login system, add a profile page, and to add the ability to comment on posts.
